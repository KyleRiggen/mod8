    -How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
      by manual testing the features as they are created.  Now I have the ability to shift the manuel testing into automated testing

    -How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
      I talk with the users.  Then see them intereact with the program.  Then make quality of life adjustments from there.

    -How do I approach designing software?
      By first learning what needs to be built.  Then iterating on it as the definition of what needs to be build gets further fleshed out.
